# Day 3 — Interactive Performance Analyzer

This project takes user input and analyzes performance using NumPy and Matplotlib.

Features:
- User-driven input
- Performance verdict
- Visual feedback
- ML-style normalization

This helped me understand how raw data becomes interpretable for ML models.
